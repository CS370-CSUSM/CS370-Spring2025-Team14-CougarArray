TODO:
* Standardized Port
Not sure where this occured but Lenny started using port 5666 despite agreed upon 6999 so i feel like we need to find time to pick a port to use and rely on that way no port issues occur anymore.
There should also be a discussion regarding port usage, if user can use a different port and how to save data of another peer different port 

* Make use of Setters & Getters in some aspects of the code
There are parts of the code where variables don't use Setters & Getters and I feel like it's not appropriate standard to directly access a variable 
(This doesn't apply to CrytographyResult, that class was suppose to act mroe like a struct)

* Better User Experience
I feel like the code is a little...unprofessional or confusing for the user (primary actor is System Administrator)
So it would be nice to clean up Console Output to make it look more appealing 

* Websocket EXECUTE packet & response
(WIP) Make it a custom packet called for people to use different programming languages to write packets to the websocket and respond to it
